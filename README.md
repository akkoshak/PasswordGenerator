## ðŸ’¡ Password Generator

This project is a simple password generator web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to generate strong, random passwords based on their preferences, such as character length and the inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The interface is user-friendly, with a slider to select the desired password length and checkboxes to customize the character set.

 - **HTML:** The structure of the web app is built with HTML. It defines the layout of the page, including elements like the password display area, slider for selecting character length, checkboxes for options (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and the "Generate" button. Essentially, HTML is responsible for the content and basic structure of the application.
 
 - **CSS:** It ensures that the application has a visually appealing and modern design. CSS is used to style the buttons, sliders, and checkboxes, as well as to control the layout, colors, and typography. It makes the application look clean and professional, providing an enhanced user experience.
 
 - **JavaScript:** The functionality of the password generator is powered by JavaScript. It manages user inputs, processes the selected options, and generates the random password based on the criteria chosen by the user. JavaScript updates the display area with the generated password and also handles events like clicking the "Generate" button and copying the password to the clipboard.
